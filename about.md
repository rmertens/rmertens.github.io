### Short bio

As of September 2017, I am working primarily on 
[CrazyGames.com](https://www.crazygames.com). My goal is to build CrazyGames into the global web gaming platform. We serve [games](https://www.crazygames.com) in about 25 languages, including: [jeux](https://www.crazygames.fr) (in French), [spiele](https://de.crazygames.com) (in German), and [giochi](https://it.crazygames.com) (in Italian).

Previously I worked as a software engineer at
[Thought Machine](https://www.thoughtmachine.net/) from the summer of 2015
until March 2016, initially on the machine learning and later on the 3-member founding team of the core banking platform Vault (both
front-end and back-end).

In the 2014-2015 academic year, I did
[Part III of the Mathematical Tripos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos)
at Cambridge and studied a variety of **applied mathematics** subjects
with a focus in statistics.

Before that, I studied **Computer Science** and **Electrical Engineering** at
Stanford University, where I won the Terman Award.
I focused on **machine learning** (inspired by
[Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)) and **convex optimization**
(inspired by Stephen Boyd and Carlos Fernandez-Granda).
I transferred to Stanford after 1 academic year at KU Leuven.

In my free time, I enjoy long distance running and travelling.
